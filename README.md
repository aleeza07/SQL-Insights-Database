ðŸ“Š Todayâ€™s SQL & Database Learnings
ðŸš€ Diving Deep into Databases & SQL

Explored the fundamentals of databasesâ€”what they are, why they matter, and how they power modern applications.

Learned the key differences between:

ðŸ”· Relational DBs (MySQL) â€“ Structured, table-based, SQL-powered.

ðŸŒ€ Non-Relational DBs (NoSQL) â€“ Flexible, scalable, document/key-value stores.

Understood SQL structure, schemas, scalability, and real-world use cases for each type.

ðŸ”¥ MySQL in Action

Mastered essential query commands:

1)SELECT â€“ Fetching data like a pro.

2)SELECT DISTINCT â€“ Eliminating duplicates for clean results.

3)WHERE â€“ Filtering data with precision.

Got hands-on with operators (=, <>, >, <, LIKE, IN, etc.) to refine queries.

ðŸ’» Real-World Practice

Applied concepts to a CRM-like database (customers, products, orders).

Wrote queries to:

1)Retrieve specific customer data.

2)Filter orders based on conditions.

3)Extract unique product entries.

Solved challenges and verified outputsâ€”solidifying my understanding!

ðŸ“‚ Attached my code snippetsâ€”check them out to see the magic in action!

Why This Matters?
SQL is the backbone of data-driven decisions, and mastering it unlocks the power to manage CRM systems, analyze trends, and optimize business logic. Every query brings me closer to database mastery!
